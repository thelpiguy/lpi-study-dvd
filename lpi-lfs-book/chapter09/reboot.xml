  <title>Rebooting the System</title>

  <para>Now that all of the software has been installed, it is time to reboot
  your computer. However, you should be aware of a few things. The system you
  have created in this book is quite minimal, and most likely will not have
  the functionality you would need to be able to continue forward. By installing
  a few extra packages from the BLFS book while still in our current chroot
  environment, you can leave yourself in a much better position to continue on
  once you reboot into your new LFS installation. Installing a text mode web
  browser, such as Lynx, you can easily view the BLFS book in one virtual
  terminal, while building packages in another. The GPM package will also allow
  you to perform copy/paste actions in your virtual terminals. Lastly, if you
  are in a situation where static IP configuration does not meet your networking
  requirements, installing packages such as Dhcpcd or PPP at this point might
  also be useful.</para>


  <para>Now that we have said that, lets move on to booting our shiny new LFS
  installation for the first time! First exit from the chroot environment:</para>

<screen><userinput>logout</userinput></screen>

  <para>Then unmount the virtual file systems:</para>

<screen><userinput>umount -v $LFS/dev/pts
umount -v $LFS/dev/shm
umount -v $LFS/dev
umount -v $LFS/proc
umount -v $LFS/sys</userinput></screen>

  <para>Unmount the LFS file system itself:</para>

<screen><userinput>umount -v $LFS</userinput></screen>

  <para>If multiple partitions were created, unmount the other
  partitions before unmounting the main one, like this:</para>

<screen role="nodump"><userinput>umount -v $LFS/usr
umount -v $LFS/home
umount -v $LFS</userinput></screen>

  <para>Now, reboot the system with:</para>

<screen role="nodump"><userinput>shutdown -r now</userinput></screen>

  <para>Assuming the GRUB boot loader was set up as outlined earlier, the menu
  is set to boot <emphasis>LFS &version;</emphasis> automatically.</para>

  <para>When the reboot is complete, the LFS system is ready for use and
  more software may be added to suit your needs.</para>
