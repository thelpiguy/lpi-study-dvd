lpi-study-dvd
=============

Linux Professional Institute Study DVD project repository for documentation, build scripts and other artifacts. This project is based upon the Linux From Scratch 7.1 book source, utilized by jhalfs (Automated Linux From Scratch) to build the entire system. Since the first release addresses the core requirements for LPIC-1 study (see documentation for package management exceptions), the LFS 7.1 book source has been forked to accomodate additional packages. Additionally, since jhalfs pulls from the LFS SVN repository, it must be modified to pull from a variety of sources, including LFS, GNU, and others. Until the mechanism for building is updated and fully tested, the LPI Study DVD will remain a development release.
